# Additional Learning Material - UNESCO's Open Learning Course

A real-world case-study was implemented using this plugin in Part 2 of UNESCO’s course on **‘GIS Techniques for Mapping Sustainable Mining | UNESCO Open Learning.** (https://openlearning.unesco.org/courses/course-v1:UNESCO+06+2021_01/about)

Details of each of the above sessions are as follows:

## 2.3 Set up of WofE Plugin in QGIS and related installations - https://youtu.be/qqlYtdDS3W0 

This video is about installation of the weights of evidence, i.e. WofE plugin and checking the availability of relevant python dependencies. Using the instructions provided in this video, you can successfully set up QGIS for implementation of the tools in the WofE plugin.

The set-up, geoprocessing and WofE plugin implementation is demonstrated in the QGIS version 3.16 (the long-term release and the most stable version at the time of preparation of this course material). However please note that the WofE plugin works properly also in the latest version - QGIS 3.20.3 'Odense' (released on 10.09.2021).

**Resources:**
- Software – QGIS (3.16 - Long term release, most stable - https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
- Plugin – Weights of Evidence (WofE) Model: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/wofe_module/; 

## 2.4 Geoprocessing to create evidence layers - https://youtu.be/7isyzVK6jLk ##

This video demonstrates creating predictor maps (raster files) from primary geoscientific datasets using different geoprocessing tools available in QGIS. These predictor maps will be used as input ‘evidence layers’ to the weights-of-evidence based prospectivity modelling using the WofE plugin in QGIS. The learning objectives of this session are: 

1.	to understand the workflow of conversion of primary data to evidence layers, and
2.	to derive evidence layers using the geoprocessing tools in QGIS.

**Resources:**
- Software – QGIS; (3.16 - Long term release, most stable - https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
- Plugin – Weights of Evidence (WofE) Model: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/wofe_module/;  
- Plugin installation and dependencies installation instructions at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqlYtdDS3W0

## 2.7 WOFE in QGIS with Case study - https://youtu.be/lTA4GC4CQz4 ##

This session demonstrates implementation of the weights of evidence method for prospectivity modelling using the WofE plugin available in QGIS. 

The datasets required for this session are the evidence layers created in Sessions 2.4 (https://youtu.be/7isyzVK6jLk) and 2.5. The main objective of this session is to be able to quantify the spatial associations between the mineral deposits or occurrences and the evidence layers. 

The results from this session will be integrated in Session no. 2.10  (https://youtu.be/YzLSEQKb6vA) on finalizing the weights of evidence based prospectivity model.

## 2.10 Finalising the WoFE model - https://youtu.be/YzLSEQKb6vA ## 

This session is continuation from Sessions 2.7 (https://youtu.be/lTA4GC4CQz4) and 2.8 with implementation of the weights of evidence method for prospectivity modelling. The datasets required for this session are the files created in Sessions 2.7and 2.8. The main objectives of this session are:

- to integrate all the generalized weights rasters in the calculate responses tool
- to finalize the prospectivity modelling results, and 
- evaluation and presentation of the prospectivity modelling results
