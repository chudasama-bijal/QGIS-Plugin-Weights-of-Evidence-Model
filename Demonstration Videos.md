# Additional Learning Material - UNESCO's Open Learning Course

A real-world case-study was implemented using this plugin in Part 2 of UNESCO’s course on **‘GIS Techniques for Mapping Sustainable Mining | UNESCO Open Learning.** (https://openlearning.unesco.org/courses/course-v1:UNESCO+06+2021_01/about)

Details of each of the above sessions are as follows:

## 2.4 Geoprocessing to create evidence layers - https://youtu.be/7isyzVK6jLk ##

This session demostrates deriving the evidence layers from primary geoscientific datasets using different geoprocessing tools available in QGIS. These evidence layers are later used as inputs to the weights-of-evidence based prospectivity modelling using the WofE plugin in QGIS. The learning objectives of this session are: 

1.	 to understand the workflow of conversion of primary data to evidence layers, and
2.	to derive evidence layers using the geoprocessing tools in QGIS.

The datasets that for this session are available for download from here: https://app.box.com/s/vmy10f90mosy0hzc8q8bkc0jgyguf0o6

## 2.7 WOFE in QGIS with Case study - https://youtu.be/lTA4GC4CQz4 ##

This session demonstrates implementation of the weights of evidence method for prospectivity modelling using the WofE plugin available in QGIS. 

The datasets required for this session are the evidence layers created in Sessions 2.4 (https://youtu.be/7isyzVK6jLk) and 2.5. The main objective of this session is to be able to quantify of the spatial associations between the mineral deposits or occurrences and the evidence layers. 

The results from this session will be integrated in Session no. 2.10  (https://youtu.be/YzLSEQKb6vA) on finalizing the weights of evidence based prospectivity model.

## 2.10 Finalising the WoFE model - https://youtu.be/YzLSEQKb6vA ## 

This session is continuation from Sessions 2.7 (https://youtu.be/lTA4GC4CQz4) and 2.8 with implementation of the weights of evidence method for prospectivity modelling. The datasets required for this session are the files created in Sessions 2.7and 2.8. The main objectives of this session are:

- to integrate all the generalized weights rasters in the calculate responses tool
- to finalize the prospectivity modelling results, and 
- evaluation and presentation of the prospectivity modelling results
